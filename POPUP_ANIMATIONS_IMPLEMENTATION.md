# Popup UI Animations Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the animations and transitions implemented for task 37 to polish the popup UI.

## Changes Made

### CSS Changes (popup.css)

1. **View Fade Transitions**

   - Added `.fade-out` and `.fade-in` classes for smooth view transitions
   - Added `fadeIn` keyframe animation (300ms duration)
   - Views now transition with opacity changes

2. **Reward Value Animations**

   - Modified `.reward-value` to use `.animate` class for count-up effect
   - Kept existing `countUp` keyframe animation

3. **Critical Hit Pulse Animation**

   - Modified `.critical-indicator` to use `.animate` class
   - Added `criticalPulse` keyframe animation (1.5s duration)
   - Includes scale and box-shadow effects for emphasis

4. **Compromise Warning Shake Animation**

   - Added `.animate` class support to `.compromise-warning`
   - Added `shake` keyframe animation (0.5s duration)
   - Creates left-right shaking motion

5. **Boss Resolve Bar Smooth Transitions**
   - Enhanced `.resolve-bar` transition timing
   - Added `.animate` class for extended animation duration (1.2s)
   - Uses cubic-bezier easing for smooth motion

### TypeScript Changes (src/popup.ts)

1. **Enhanced switchView() Function**

   - Added fade-out/fade-in logic for view transitions
   - Checks `animationsEnabled` setting before applying animations
   - Falls back to instant transitions when animations disabled
   - Added helper functions:
     - `getCurrentViewElement()` - Gets current view DOM element
     - `getViewElement()` - Gets view DOM element by ViewState
     - `showViewWithFade()` - Shows view with fade-in animation

2. **Enhanced updateRewardView() Function**

   - Added `animateRewardValue()` calls for Soul Insight, Soul Embers, and Boss Damage
   - Staggered animation delays (0ms, 100ms, 200ms) for cascading effect
   - Added animation classes to critical indicator and compromise warning
   - Checks `animationsEnabled` setting throughout

3. **New animateRewardValue() Function**

   - Animates individual reward values from 0 to final value
   - Uses `animateCounter()` for smooth count-up effect
   - Supports custom delay for staggered animations
   - Adds/removes `.animate` class for CSS transitions

4. **Enhanced updateIdleView() Function**

   - Added smooth transition for XP bar
   - Respects `animationsEnabled` setting
   - Added animation class to boss Resolve bar

5. **Enhanced updateBreakView() Function**
   - Added animation class to boss Resolve bar
   - Respects `animationsEnabled` setting

## Animation Specifications

### Timing

- View transitions: 300ms
- XP bar fill: 1500ms
- Number count-up: 1000ms per value
- Critical pulse: 1500ms
- Compromise shake: 500ms
- Resolve bar: 1200ms (with animate class)

### Easing Functions

- View fades: ease-in-out
- XP bar: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Number count-up: ease-out-quart (custom)
- Resolve bar: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

### Staggered Delays

- Soul Insight: 0ms
- Soul Embers: 100ms
- Boss Damage: 200ms

## Settings Integration

All animations respect the `animationsEnabled` setting from `GameState.settings`:

```typescript
const animationsEnabled = currentState?.settings.animationsEnabled ?? true;
```

When animations are disabled:

- View transitions are instant
- Progress bars update immediately
- Numbers show final values instantly
- No pulse or shake effects

## Testing

See `src/test-popup-animations.md` for comprehensive manual testing instructions.

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the design document:

- **Requirement 2.5**: Reward screen displays with animations
- **Requirement 13.1**: Content Soul animations (already implemented, this adds UI polish)
- **Requirement 13.2**: Collection animations (already implemented, this adds UI polish)

## Performance Considerations

- All animations use CSS transitions/animations for GPU acceleration
- JavaScript only updates values, CSS handles visual effects
- Animations can be disabled for better performance on low-end devices
- No animation loops that could cause memory leaks

## Browser Compatibility

- Tested on Chrome (Manifest V3 requirement)
- Uses standard CSS animations and transitions
- No vendor prefixes needed for modern Chrome

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future tasks:

- Add sound effects to animations (when sound system implemented)
- Add particle effects for critical hits
- Add more elaborate boss defeat animations
- Add level-up celebration animations
- Add micro-interactions for button clicks
