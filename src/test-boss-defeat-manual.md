### Test 5: Level Up During Boss Defeat

2. Set boss Resolve low enough to defeat
3. Current level below next boss unlock requirement

**Steps:**

1. Complete a session that both defeats boss and levels up player
2. Observe if level up happens before boss unlock check

**Expected Results:**

- Player levels up first
- If new level meets next boss requirement, boss unlocks
- If new level still too low, boss remains locked
- Both level-up and boss defeat notifications appear

## Manual State Editing (for testing)

To manually edit state for testing:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Storage → Local Storage
3. Find `soulShepherdState` key
4. Edit the JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "player": {
       "level": 1,  // Change this
       "soulInsight": 0,
       "soulInsightToNextLevel": 100,
       ...
     },
     "progression": {
       "currentBossIndex": 0,  // Change this (0-9)
       "currentBossResolve": 50,  // Change this
       ...
     }
   }
   ```
5. Reload the extension popup

## Console Logging

Watch the background service worker console for:

- `[Background] Boss defeated!`
- `[Background] Next boss available: [name]`
- `[Background] Boss unlocked: [name]` (if level sufficient)
- `[Background] Boss locked: [name] requires level X, player is level Y` (if level too low)
- `[Background] All bosses defeated - campaign complete!` (if final boss)
