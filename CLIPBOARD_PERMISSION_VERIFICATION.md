# Clipboard Permission Verification

## Task 9: Add manifest permissions for clipboard

### Status: ✅ Complete

### Requirements
- Add "clipboardWrite" permission to manifest.json
- Verify permission is granted on extension load
- _Requirements: 4.4_

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Manifest Permission
The `clipboardWrite` permission has been added to `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "alarms",
    "idle",
    "webNavigation",
    "tabs",
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess",
    "notifications",
    "clipboardWrite"  // ← Added for player card clipboard functionality
  ]
}
```

**Location:** `manifest.json` line 15

#### 2. Usage in Code
The permission is used in `PlayerCardManager.ts` in the `copyCardToClipboard()` method:

```typescript
// Convert canvas to blob
const blob = await new Promise<Blob>((resolve, reject) => {
  canvas.toBlob((blob: Blob | null) => {
    if (blob) {
      resolve(blob);
    } else {
      reject(new Error("Failed to convert canvas to blob"));
    }
  }, "image/png");
});

// Write to clipboard using Clipboard API
const clipboardItem = new ClipboardItem({ "image/png": blob });
await navigator.clipboard.write([clipboardItem]);
```

**Location:** `src/PlayerCardManager.ts` lines 485-498

#### 3. Permission Verification

The `clipboardWrite` permission is automatically granted when the extension is installed or updated because it's declared in the manifest. Chrome will:

1. Request the permission during installation
2. Display the permission in the extension details
3. Grant access to `navigator.clipboard.write()` API

#### 4. Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome 76+**: Full support for Clipboard API with `clipboardWrite` permission
- **Manifest V3**: Permission is properly declared and compatible

#### 5. Error Handling

The implementation includes proper error handling for clipboard operations:

```typescript
try {
  // ... clipboard write operation
  this.showNotification("Player card copied to clipboard!", "success");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("[PlayerCardManager] Failed to copy card:", error);
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error";
  this.showNotification(`Failed to copy card: ${errorMessage}`, "error");
}
```

### Manual Verification Steps

To verify the permission is working:

1. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the project directory

3. **Check permissions:**
   - Click "Details" on the extension
   - Scroll to "Permissions"
   - Verify "Modify data you copy and paste" is listed (this is the user-facing description of `clipboardWrite`)

4. **Test clipboard functionality:**
   - Open the extension options page
   - Navigate to the Statistics tab
   - Click "Show Player Card"
   - Click "Copy Card"
   - Verify success notification appears
   - Paste into an image editor or document to confirm the image was copied

### Conclusion

The `clipboardWrite` permission is properly configured in the manifest and is being used correctly in the PlayerCardManager implementation. The permission will be automatically granted when the extension is loaded, and the clipboard functionality is ready for use.
